2. Copy php_win32service.dll into your PHP extension directory, usually C:\php5\ext.

3. Add the following line in the dynamic extensions section of php.ini. You do not need 
   to restart your web server.

4. Register the Scheduler as a service by running the following from the command line:

	/live/admin/setup-install-win32-scheduler.bat

   You will be prompted to enter the path to your php.exe file before the service can be added

5. Verify the service and make changes as necessary to Ensight Scheduler Win32 in the Windows 
   service interface. You may be required to assign a suitable Windows login and password.
